# AKScript programming langage

## Very basic syntax
### [Function] ...[args]

## Interpreted language
### The language runs via entering an source code file into the interpreter through the console. Then, the runtime is created.

## Made in C
### In the modern world, C is the language of choice for creating interpreters and compilers. This is because it is simple enough to write consise, readable code, yet abstract enough to manipulate a computer's memory with ease.

## In progress
### If you have any recommendations, add me on discord (AK#7755) and you can make a request.

## Open source
### If you ever feel like contributing to the project, feel free to make a pull request and I can take a look at your source code.

## Functionality

### exit [code: int]
